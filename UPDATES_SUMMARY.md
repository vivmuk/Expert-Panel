## 2. ü§ñ Venice AI Model Updates

### Current Configuration (Option A - Performance-Focused)

```python
PERSONA_GENERATION_MODEL = "deepseek-r1-671b"    # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UPGRADED
INSIGHT_GENERATION_MODEL = "llama-3.3-70b"       # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UPGRADED
SEARCH_ANALYSIS_MODEL = "mistral-32-24b"         # ‚úÖ UNCHANGED (optimal)
SYNTHESIS_MODEL = "deepseek-r1-671b"              # ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UPGRADED
```

### Why These Changes?

#### DeepSeek R1 671B (for Persona Generation & Synthesis)
- **Context**: 131K tokens (vs 131K for qwen3-235b)
- **Capabilities**: Advanced reasoning support
- **Cost**: $3.50/$14.00 per M tokens (higher but worth it for quality)
- **Why**: Most powerful model for orchestration and synthesis tasks
- **Best for**: Complex strategic reasoning and multi-perspective synthesis

#### Llama 3.3 70B (for Insight Generation)
- **Context**: 65K tokens
- **Released**: December 2024 (newer than Llama 3.1)
- **Cost**: $0.70/$2.80 per M tokens (53% cheaper than 3.1 405B!)
- **Why**: Excellent balance of quality and cost
- **Best for**: Individual expert analysis with good reasoning

#### Mistral 32 24B (unchanged)
- **Context**: 131K tokens
- **Cost**: $0.50/$2.00 per M tokens
- **Why**: Already optimal for market analysis and search tasks
- **Best for**: Real-time market intelligence gathering

## 3. üéØ Alternative Model Configurations

### Option B: Cost-Optimized (Good Balance)
```python
PERSONA_GENERATION_MODEL = "qwen3-235b"          # Original, reliable
INSIGHT_GENERATION_MODEL = "llama-3.3-70b"       # Upgraded, cheaper
SEARCH_ANALYSIS_MODEL = "mistral-32-24b"         # Unchanged
SYNTHESIS_MODEL = "qwen3-235b"                    # Original, solid
```
**Best for**: Budget-conscious users who still want good quality

### Option C: Maximum Power (Highest Quality)
```python
PERSONA_GENERATION_MODEL = "deepseek-r1-671b"    # Most powerful
INSIGHT_GENERATION_MODEL = "llama-3.1-405b"      # Original, maximum capability
SEARCH_ANALYSIS_MODEL = "mistral-32-24b"         # Unchanged
SYNTHESIS_MODEL = "deepseek-r1-671b"              # Most powerful
```
**Best for**: Critical decisions requiring absolute best quality
